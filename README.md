#express and mysql API

this is a dead simple example of API usgin express.js & mysql


```
$ git clone http://github.com/gillchristian/express-mysql-api.git
$ cd express-mysql-api
$ npm install
$ nodemon app.js
```

note that I'm using [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/), you need to have it installed globally first. You can also just use node: `$ node app.js`, but you'll have to restart the app everytime you make a change.
